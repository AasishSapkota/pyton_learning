It's my 6th day journey being recorded.
Today i have learned about variable and different type of data types in python
first i've learned that a variable is a container that has unique name and it stores different type of values in it the name of variable is called identifier.
Identifier points to the memory address where the data is stored.
There are many types of data type some of the basic data types are:
1.Integer
2.String
3.Boolean
4.List
5.Tuples
6.Dictionary
Integer,boolean and string are basic data types .
List is a collection of different types of data which is mutable
Tuples is also collection but it stores single type of data and it is non mutable
Dictionary(dict) in other hand i also a collection of data in the form of Key:value it is mutable.
