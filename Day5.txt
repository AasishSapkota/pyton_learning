It's my 5th day journey being recorded.
Today I have learned  how to use comment , escape sequence ,
and some feature of print() statement some features.
I found out  that there are two types of comment in python:
   Single line comment
   Multi line comment
In single line comment we use # to comment things that are on same line after 
# this will be commented

In multiple line we use 3 quotation to open comment and 3 quotation for closing comment
‘’’It will be commented ‘’’

And i learned about 'sep' also known as separator that is used in print statement to add user intended separator.
and i have learned about end escapes to like \n is used for line seperation

Here are some link of content and resource that i have used if needed you can use it :
