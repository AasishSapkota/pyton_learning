It's my 3rd day journey being recorded.
Today I have learned what modules and pip and how to install modules using pip.
Summary: As you know that i am following #100daysofcoding
and i am following codewithharry #100daysofpython and today
i have learned what is pip and what is module i have learned that there are 2 types of module .
built in modules that are built in modules available in the language
whereas external modules are those modules that are built by others and are available to be installed
and used by the developer. We can create our own module which we can also say are external modules.
And where as pip is the package manager of python which we use to install packages and modules in the python.

I've also included links to some of the resources I used if anybody interested can follow along.
